# valentines
My attempt at making a black belt exam in MEAN for Coding Dojo. Uses a self-join to allow users to send valentine messages to other users.

## How to get it running
1. Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed. On a Debian/Ubuntu based OS run:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install node
$ sudo apt-get install npm
```

2. Make sure Bower is installed. To install Bower:
```
$ npm install -g bower
```

3. With npm and bower installed, next install the node modules and bower components. From within the project folder run:
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

4. Start the server:
```
$ node server.js
```
